  title: "Reflecting on what you’ve discovered"
  intro: |
    Every reflection deepens awareness.
    Before closing this exploration, take a moment to notice what has shifted within you.
    Awareness grows not only from answers, but from the space created by the questions themselves.
    This reflection helps you recognize what you’ve learned, what insights you’re taking with you, and how this process may continue to unfold.
  questions:
    - "What stands out to you the most from this conversation about **{value}**?"
    - "What new understanding or awareness did you gain about yourself through this session?"
    - "How might this insight influence the way you live or make choices moving forward?"
    - "Is there something you feel grateful for or at peace with after reflecting on this value?"
  reflection: |
    Taking time to acknowledge your insights helps them integrate on a deeper level.
    Awareness becomes transformation when it is seen, named, and felt.
    This moment of reflection closes the circle — and opens space for new growth.
