- section: "Meaning of the Value"
  title: "What does this value mean to you?"
  intro: |
    Every value holds a different meaning for each of us.
    Words like love, freedom, or responsibility may sound universal, yet they come alive only through our own understanding and experience.
    Before exploring where your values come from or how they influence your life, it's important to clarify what this particular value truly means to you.
    This awareness creates a foundation for deeper reflection and more authentic connection with what matters most.
  questions:
    - "When you think about the value **{wartosc}**, what does it personally mean to you?"
    - "How would you describe this value in your own words — beyond general definitions?"
    - "What does living in alignment with this value look or feel like in your everyday life?"
  reflection: |
    Defining what a value means to you turns an abstract idea into something real and personal.
    It's not about finding the right definition, but about discovering your own truth — what this value represents in your unique experience.


- section: "Living the Value"
  title: "How much is this value present in your life?"
  intro: |
    Sometimes we deeply care about a value, yet we don't fully experience it in our daily life.
    A value can be central to who we are — and still feel distant or unfulfilled.
    Exploring how much this value is truly lived helps us notice possible gaps between what matters to us and what we actually experience.
    This awareness is not for judgment, but for understanding — to see what might need more attention, courage, or opportunity.
  questions:
    - "To what extent do you feel the value **{wartosc}** is present and alive in your current life?"
    - "In what situations do you experience this value most strongly, and where does it feel missing?"
    - "What might need to change or open up for you to live this value more fully?"
  reflection: |
    Recognizing the difference between what we value and what we live is the first step toward alignment.
    Awareness invites choice — and every small act that honors your values brings more coherence and authenticity into your life.


- section: "Beliefs and Values Connection"
  title: "Our values arise from our beliefs"
  intro: |
    Our values don't exist in isolation — they arise from our beliefs, from what we hold to be true about ourselves, others, and the world.
    Every value we care about is supported by an underlying belief: a conviction about what is right, possible, or necessary.
    By exploring these beliefs, we can understand not only *what* matters to us, but *why* it matters — and how these beliefs shape the way we live, choose, and relate to others.
  questions:
    - "What do you believe to be true that makes the value **{wartosc}** so important to you?"
    - "Where do you think this belief comes from — was it learned, experienced, or chosen consciously?"
    - "How does this belief influence the way you act or make decisions in your life?"
  reflection: |
    When you explore the beliefs behind your values, you gain a deeper understanding of what drives you.
    Some beliefs empower us, others limit us — becoming aware of them opens the door to conscious choice and transformation.


- section: "Values and Identity"
  title: "Our values shape who we are"
  intro: |
    Our values don't just guide our actions — they shape our very sense of identity.
    What we hold as truly important defines how we see ourselves and how we want to show up in the world.
    When we live in alignment with our core values, we feel authentic, whole, and at peace with ourselves.
    When we act against them, we often experience tension, confusion, or loss of direction.
    Exploring this connection helps us understand not only what matters to us, but also *who we become* because of it.
  questions:
    - "How does the value **{wartosc}** reflect who you are or who you aspire to be?"
    - "When you live in alignment with this value, how does it affect your sense of identity?"
    - "What happens to your sense of self when you move away from this value?"
  reflection: |
    Our identity is a living expression of our values.
    Becoming aware of which values define us allows us to consciously shape who we are — not by imitation, but by choice.


- section: "Values and Decisions"
  title: "Our values guide our choices"
  intro: |
    Every decision we make — big or small — reflects our values, whether we are aware of it or not.
    Our values act like an internal compass, helping us navigate uncertainty and choose what feels right and meaningful.
    When we make decisions aligned with our values, we experience clarity, confidence, and peace of mind.
    When we go against them, we often feel doubt, inner conflict, or regret.
    Exploring how each value influences our decisions helps us bring more consciousness and integrity into our daily choices.
  questions:
    - "How does the value **{wartosc}** influence the decisions you make in your everyday life?"
    - "Can you recall a decision where you clearly acted in alignment with this value? What was the outcome?"
    - "What kind of decisions tend to move you away from this value, and how does that feel afterward?"
  reflection: |
    Becoming aware of how your values shape your decisions allows you to make choices that are truly your own.
    Each conscious choice strengthens your integrity — the alignment between what you believe, value, and do.


- section: "Living Your Values in Action"
  title: "Bringing your values into everyday life"
  intro: |
    Values become real when they are lived — when they find expression in your daily choices, actions, and relationships.
    It's not enough to know what matters to you; true fulfillment comes from embodying your values in tangible ways.
    This step is about translating awareness into practice — finding small, meaningful actions that reflect who you are and what you stand for.
    Living your values doesn't require perfection — only intention, attention, and consistency.
  questions:
    - "What specific actions or habits could help you live the value **{wartosc}** more fully in your daily life?"
    - "What would it look like if this value guided the way you act, speak, and make decisions each day?"
    - "What small change could you make this week to bring this value into real expression?"
  reflection: |
    When your actions align with your values, you create integrity — a sense of wholeness between who you are, what you believe, and how you live.
    Each small step that embodies your values builds trust in yourself and deepens your sense of purpose.
